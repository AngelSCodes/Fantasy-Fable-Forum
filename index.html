            Meet Lady Amelia Smallhope, for whom there is no problem that can't be solved by a drink and a think.

            Everyone's favourite bounty hunters. Sorry - recovery agents. No bad guy they can't handle. No expense account too flexible. No adventure too outrageous.
            
            Join them as they settle scores, break every rule in the book and take the world by storm.
            
            Fasten your seatbelts. The timeline doesn't know what's hit it.
